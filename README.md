## Examples

## Setup
For dependency management, [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) is being used. As the `Pods` folder is not included, installing [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) and the dependencies with it is required to run the project.

If you haven't installed it on your system yet, continue with the following steps:
1. `sudo gem install cocoapods`
 - will ask for your password
2. `pod setup`
 - sets up CocoaPods master repository
3. `cd [wherever you cloned Lightsy]/Lightsy`
 - basically `cd` to the folder in which lies the Podfile of Lightsy
4. `pod install`
 - installs dependencies

## Future
- [ ] macOS App
